 - the performance test is very different if you do it on Xcode or on command line with -O3
 - to circumvent the slow down with >>= in Double::AddTo, represent a Double as a BitSet, where the first bs represent the mantissa and the others the part > 1
 - make sure that Double::AddTo does not alter the content of *addend
 - if you run  void SpeedTestUnsignedIntAddTo and instead of calling once (A[s]).SubstractTo(&(B[s]), &carry) you call it twice, the execution time does not change and it stays smaller than the executio time without bits -> The gillespie simulation should be improved by the approach with bits
